# Project Overview
The goal of this project is to predict the insurance price (premium) for a given individual based on features such as age, sex, bmi, children, smoker status, and region. A regression-based machine learning model is used to estimate the premium cost that an insurance company would charge for an individual.

# Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the model is the Insurance dataset. It contains the following columns:

age: Age of the policyholder

sex: Gender of the policyholder (male or female)

bmi: Body Mass Index

children: Number of children/dependents

smoker: Whether the policyholder smokes or not

region: The region where the policyholder lives

charges: The target variable (insurance price/premium)
